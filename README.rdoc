== About Backup My App

Backup My App is a snapshot-style backup service for Rails applications. It performs daily backup of your files and database and you can restore your data automatically if something goes wrong on your server.

We store only everyday changes applied to the files. It saves both bandwidth and backup size. So you can access backup history for several weeks or even months depending of the size of your application and your activity. If the space approaches the limit, most distant day from your backup history will be removed.
